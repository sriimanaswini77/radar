Here is a clear explanation of the problem statement, contextualized to your radar sequence prediction task:

### Problem Statement Overview

You have a radar system whose state at each moment is described by position (`pos_x`, `pos_y`, `pos_z`), velocity (`vel_x`, `vel_y`, `vel_z`), and its current range to target. Your goal is to predict, based on these input features, **multiple future points in space (where interception or a radar event occurs)** and **the times at which these events happen**.

#### Inputs
- Three-dimensional position of the radar: `pos_x`, `pos_y`, `pos_z`
- Three-dimensional velocity of the radar: `vel_x`, `vel_y`, `vel_z`
- Instantaneous range to the target: `range`

#### Outputs
- The predicted coordinates for future points (up to four, labeled as `pipx1, pipy1, pipz1, ... pipx4, pipy4, pipz4`). Each set describes an intercept location in 3D space.
- The predicted time(s) taken to reach each of these points (`tgt_time1, tgt_time2, tgt_time3, tgt_time4`).

### Real-World Context

This kind of problem is common in radar and trajectory prediction research for applications such as air traffic control, autonomous vehicles, or defense systems. The aim is to **forecast the likely future locations and exact moments when the radar or missile will intersect with predicted trajectory points**, given the observed dynamics.[2][5]

### Why Is It Challenging?
- Multiple outputs: You predict not just a single endpoint, but several possible future waypoints and their times.
- Sequence dependence: Each prediction may depend on the previous state—hence the use of sequential models (like LSTM).
- Physical constraints: Your predictions must obey physical laws of motion, and radar data can have noise or nonlinearity.

### Typical Applications

- **Missile target interception**: Given launch position, velocity, and initial range, predict the next points and times of missile/radar intersection.
- **Aircraft tracking**: Identify location and time where an aircraft will intercept waypoints, based on current state.

| Multi-point, multi-time trajectory prediction | Radar 3D position, velocity, range (`pos_x, pos_y, pos_z, vel_x, vel_y, vel_z, range`) | Predicted 3D intercept points (`pipx1, pipy1, pipz1, ... pipx4, pipy4, pipz4`) and target times | Radar-based guidance, tracking |

Your machine learning model learns to predict **future intercept points and the times to reach them** based on the radar's current position, velocity, and range data.



An interception point, in the context of radar and guidance systems, is **the specific location in space where a radar-guided object (such as a missile, aircraft, or drone) is expected to meet or cross paths with its moving target**.[6][8]

### Key Characteristics of Interception Points
- It is computed based on the current position, velocity, and direction of both the interceptor (the radar-guided object) and the target.
- The interception point is often a predicted location where the "interceptor" can reach the target at the same time, allowing for successful engagement, tracking, or identification.[6]
- In practical guidance algorithms, this point is dynamically recalculated throughout the mission as both objects move and change velocity, to ensure the most probable success for interception.[8]

### Radar Use Case
- Radar systems continuously update their target's position and velocity, then calculate where and when their own vehicle or missile needs to be, so their paths cross.
- The system may predict multiple possible interception points ahead, depending on mission or scenario (like air combat, missile guidance, or trajectory prediction).

### Visual Example
Imagine an aircraft using radar to home in on another moving aircraft:
- The radar calculates future "meeting points" in 3D space.
- The system chooses the optimal one based on speed, heading, and time to target.

In your dataset, each interception point (`pipx1, pipy1, pipz1`, etc.) corresponds to a set of coordinates where the radar-equipped object is expected to reach the moving target based on current dynamics. The associated "target time" entries represent how long it will take to get there.

An interception point, in clear and simple terms, is:

- **The place where a moving object (like an aircraft or missile) and its target are predicted to meet at the same time, based on their current positions and velocities.**
- In your radar context, it's the exact 3D location where the radar-guided object will reach the target if both maintain their current speed and direction.[11]

#### Visual Scenario
- Imagine a police car chasing another car. The interception point is where the police car would "catch up" to the other car if both continue on their paths.
- For radar tracking, the interception point is not just visually projected, but calculated using data about both objects' positions, directions, and speeds.

#### In Your Data
- Your model predicts several such points (`pipx1, pipy1, pipz1` etc.). Each point is a possible future location where your radar or missile would arrive at the same moment as the target.
- The corresponding interception time (`tgt_time1` etc.) is how long it would take to get there, starting from the radar's current state.

#### Summary Table

| Term                 | Meaning                                                                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Interception Point   | 3D coordinates where the interceptor and target arrive at the same time                  |
| How predicted        | Using radar's and target's positions, velocities, and directions                         |
| Example              | Missile and aircraft meet at the same place at the same moment                           |
| In your model        | `pipx1, pipy1, pipz1` etc. denote each predicted interception location                   |

So, an interception point is simply **where and when the paths of the radar-guided object and its target will cross if both move as currently observed**.
